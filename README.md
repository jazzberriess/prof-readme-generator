## Installation
To run the README Generator, you'll first need to clone the [prof-readme-generator repo on GitHub](https://github.com/jazzberriess/prof-readme-generator) or download the zipfile, then [install the inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

To install inquirer.js, navigate to the root directory of the cloned or downloaded repo. In either your terminal, command line or using the integrated terminal in your code editor of choice, enter the following command:

`npm i inquirer`

OR

`npm install inquirer`

## Usage
To use the README generator, clone or download the repo and install inquirer.js as instructed above.

Next, enter the following command in either your terminal, command line or using the integrated terminal in your code editor of choice:

`node index.js`

Then, answer the prompts.

Once the prompts have been filled, a `README.md` file will be generated in the root folder of the directory for you to then copy or move to whichever project it is for.
